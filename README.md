This repository is a minimal reproduction project in Godot 4.4.1 (C#). When the headless ENet server crosses an internal connection threshold during the handshake phase, the CPU briefly spikes and then disconnects every client in one sweep. The project contains a single Godot workspace with two export presets—one for a dedicated server and one for a lightweight client—so you can replicate the issue by exporting both builds and running them on separate machines. Full context and ongoing discussion can be found in the forum thread: https://forum.godotengine.org/t/enet-server-drops-all-clients-at-connection-threshold/117785.
